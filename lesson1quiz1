1. What is the value of a after the below code is executed?
  a = 1
  b = a
  b = 3

a = 1

2. What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?

An array holds elements of any type, including other arrays or hashes.
A hash holds key/value pairs.

3. Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
=>[1,2,3,3]

[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq
=>[1,2,3,3]
--[1,2,3], but original arr is not changed

[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!
=>[1,2,3]

4. What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.
Map creates a new array containing the information returned by the block.
Select also creates a new array, but only with the elements for which the given block returns as true.

Select is helpful if you're looking to create a new array but have more specific attributes, such as only needing elements meeting a certain description.


5. Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

animals = {"dog" => "woof", "cat" => "meow", "duck" => "quack"}

6. What is returned?

  x = 1

  x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

=>"yes,sir!"
--answer is "no way", code to the left is executed when true

7. What is x?

  x = 1

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end

  puts x

=>4

8. What is x?

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end

  puts x

  =>undefined method '+', as x has not been declared as a local variable
